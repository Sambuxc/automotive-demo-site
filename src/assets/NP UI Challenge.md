#   Rational

Accurately recreate the visuals found: https://www.figma.com/file/MrZR9TZOVrI8pwBjJuDprZ/Code-Review-Template?node-id=1%3A2&mode=dev

The focus should be on the element named "Listings Feed" (found via the left column) which contains the main vehicle cards.
Consider the design as it changes breakpoint, the site content widths and the responsive nature of the design.
Whilst there is no need to recreate the other elements on the page (e.g. site header/footer or side filters) consider their positioning and how they interact with your work (TIP: using placeholder elements just to fill those spaces might be a good idea)


#   Requirements

Clean, semantic and accessible SCSS and HTML, written to best practices,  ideally project to be built in VueJS/Nuxt.  Assume only the latest browser support required (no IE).
Use GitHub to track changes and commit your code to.  There is a JSON file with mock vehicle data attached to the email sent which represents typical response data we get from the api.  If you want to use it to populate the cards, please do so.
